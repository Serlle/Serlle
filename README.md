- Backend: Ruby on Rails, API design, Pundit (authorization), RSpec (testing)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, core JavaScript (ES6+)
- Databases & deployment: PostgreSQL, Docker (basic)
- Exports / performance: report generation, preloads/includes to avoid N+1

## 💡 How I work
- I prefer readable, testable code and code reviews via Pull Requests.

- I focus on avoiding performance issues (e.g., N+1, heavy queries) and providing a reliable export UX (background jobs for large files).
